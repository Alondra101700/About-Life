<h1> About Life </h1>
<p> I am a current senior. I have a lot struggles in all of my classes especially in my two AP class. 
  My two AP class is AP Statistic and AP Government and Politics. By the way I got accept to three university 
  which are Dominguez Hills, Humboldt State, and Mt.St.Mary's. So let's finish my school stuff and start with 
  my hobbies. My hobbies are reading on Wattpad, draw random things, and read a lot of books. Something that 
  I will would recommend doing is use the app Wattpad.</p>
